# End-To-End Agentic AI Projects With LangGraph

This project demonstrates how to build agentic AI applications using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). It includes practical, end-to-end examples for constructing, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents for real-world tasks.

## Project Structure

- **AINews/**  
  Contains daily and yearly AI news summaries generated by agentic workflows.
- **src/langgraphagenticai/**  
  Core source code for agent nodes, workflows, and utilities.
- **requirements.txt**  
  Python dependencies for running the project.

## Features

- Automated news summarization using agentic workflows
- Modular node-based architecture for extensibility
- Integration with LLMs and external APIs
- Example notebooks for hands-on learning

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PrinceGupta8/End-To-End-Agentic-AI-Projects-With-LangGraph.git
   cd "16- End To End Agentic AI Projects With LangGraph"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys (e.g., OpenAI).

4. **Run the application**
   ```sh
   streamlit run src/langgraphagenticai/main.py
   ```

5. **Explore the notebooks**
   - Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `10- Getting started with LangGraph/` and related folders for guided tutorials.

## Example: News Summarization

The [AINewsNode](src/langgraphagenticai/Nodes/ai_news_node.py) class fetches and summarizes AI news, saving results to markdown files like [AINews/daily_summary.md](AINews/daily_summary.md) and [AINews/year_summary.md](AINews/year_summary.md).
